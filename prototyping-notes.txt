DEVELOPMENT NOTES

defined AUDIO_GUITARTUNER_BLOCKS value of 24 changed to 6 for
faster analysis at the sacrafice of less lower frequency detection
which is not required for this application.

Blocks : lowest frequncy (rough estimate) : milliseconds per note
3 : 233hz : 9
4 : 174hz : 12
5 : 139hz : 15



A weak magnet for the coil is has a low signal to noise ratio.
A stronger magnet provides a high signal to noise ration.
An overly strong magnet over dampens the string vibrations reducing the length of the signal.


TeensyStep async is not working, also forum indicates changing 
parameters on the fly my not be supported

AccelStepper library is awkward and not intuitive when attempting 
to get async movements working. Basically just roll my own driving code
as I need only basic features (speeds and modest acceleration).


DC-Motor

Fast motor (N25 500RPM) : fast but not precise

Slow motor (N20 50RPM) : slow but precise

Precision due to the delay of frequency detections allow for more in sync timing tuning and motor turn off.

Turn tests: start, turn, test, turn, end
400.03 - full - 246.60 - full - 399.67
427.02 - full - 272.89 - full - 429.36

A full rotation roughly spans 8 notes.

Estimated Hz per rotation: 153.78
				per degre: 0.4271

0.12815 hz / millisecond (estimated from full turn test)
0.05714 hz / millisecond (estimated from note to note test (with pickStall)) ~350ms motor time per note.


TEST MOTOR:
6v, 50RPM (no load), 24oz/in (crude test), 1200ms per revolution. 
Pololu's N20 6v (low power) 54RPM has a oz/in of 24 which is on par with out test motor.

The current torque is capable of turning the peg (of our current test string (high E)).

Test indicate time between notes ~350ms (average), but high notes (A440) take 900ms
meaning the current motor does not have enough torque.

	About one hz per full step (in middle range notes).
