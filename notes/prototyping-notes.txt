DEVELOPMENT NOTES:

defined AUDIO_GUITARTUNER_BLOCKS value of 24 changed to 6 for
faster analysis at the sacrafice of less lower frequency detection
which is not required for this application.

Blocks : lowest frequncy (rough estimate) : milliseconds per note
3 : 233hz : 9
4 : 174hz : 12
5 : 139hz : 15


A weak magnet for the coil is has a low signal to noise ratio.
A stronger magnet provides a high signal to noise ration.
An overly strong magnet over dampens the string vibrations reducing the length of the signal.
